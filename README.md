## Local Preview

Flutter is installed on this machine at:

```text
C:\src\flutter\flutter_windows_3.38.6-stable\flutter\bin\flutter.bat
```

Run the app locally:

```powershell
cd "D:\DCAM\Guruvandan app\guruvandan_flutter"
& "C:\src\flutter\flutter_windows_3.38.6-stable\flutter\bin\flutter.bat" pub get
& "C:\src\flutter\flutter_windows_3.38.6-stable\flutter\bin\flutter.bat" run -d chrome
```

Build web:

```powershell
& "C:\src\flutter\flutter_windows_3.38.6-stable\flutter\bin\flutter.bat" build web
```

## Live Web App

This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow that builds Flutter Web and deploys it to GitHub Pages.

Expected public URL after GitHub Pages is enabled:

```text
https://ajaybhatnagar1712.github.io/Guru-vandan/
```

## Firebase

The project currently uses Firebase project values discovered from the Android repo:

- project id: `guru-vandan`
- realtime database: `https://guru-vandan-default-rtdb.asia-southeast1.firebasedatabase.app/`
- storage bucket: `guru-vandan.firebasestorage.app`

Before production, create proper Firebase web and iOS apps in the same Firebase project and replace placeholder values in `lib/main.dart`.

## Sign In Setup

The app asks first-time users to sign in before entering the routine screens.
After sign-in, it collects first, middle, and last name separately. The home
screen greets the devotee by first name only.

Supported sign-in methods:

- Google sign-in
- Phone number OTP sign-in

On web, Google sign-in tries Firebase popup login first and automatically falls
back to redirect login if the browser closes or blocks the popup.

Enable these in Firebase Console:

```text
Firebase Console -> Authentication -> Sign-in method
```

For the live web app, also add this under Firebase authorized domains:

```text
ajaybhatnagar1712.github.io
```

If Google sign-in opens briefly and returns without signing in, check these first:

- Google provider is enabled in Firebase Authentication
- `ajaybhatnagar1712.github.io` is listed in authorized domains
- The Firebase web app id in `lib/main.dart` matches the Firebase project

## Admin Console

Open the private admin route directly:

```text
https://ajaybhatnagar1712.github.io/Guru-vandan/#/admin
```

The quote manager stores English and Hindi together, lists the newest entries
first, and allows existing quotes to be edited from the same page.

Allowed admin email is currently:

```text
ajaybhatnagar1712@gmail.com
```
